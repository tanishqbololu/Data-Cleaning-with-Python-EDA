# Data-Cleaning-with-Python-EDA
This repository provides a comprehensive approach to transforming raw data into clean, actionable insights using Python. It leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to preprocess, clean, and prepare data for further analysis or modeling.

The project addresses various data quality issues in raw datasets and prepares them for analysis. Here's a summary of the steps taken:

1. Raw Data Issues:
  * The raw data contained numerous irregularities, including patterns requiring regex for cleanup, missing values, and unstructured entries.
  
2. Data Cleaning with Regex:
  * Applied regular expressions to clean and standardize the raw data, addressing various formatting issues.
    
3. Handling Missing Values:
  * Imputed missing values in numerical columns with appropriate statistical measures (e.g., mean, median).
  * Addressed missing categorical data by filling with suitable categories or modes.
    
4. Exporting Cleaned Data:
  * Saved the cleaned data to a new CSV file for further use and analysis.
    
5. Data Visualization:
  * Created plots and visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore and analyze the cleaned data.

6. Data Splitting:
  * Separated the dataset into independent variables (X) and the dependent variable (Y) for modeling purposes.

7. Categorical Data Encoding:
  * Converted categorical variables into numerical formats to facilitate analysis and modeling.

8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  * Completed an EDA to uncover insights, patterns, and relationships within the cleaned dataset.
